# Product Mission

## Pitch
Agent Hub is a web application that helps AI developers and teams using Claude Code share and discover agent files by providing a simple platform to post, browse, and reuse Claude Code agent configurations.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **AI Developers**: Individual developers building AI agents with Claude Code who want to share their work and learn from others
- **Development Teams**: Teams collaborating on AI agent projects who need a centralized place to share and discover reusable agent configurations

### User Personas
**AI Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Software developer or AI engineer working with Claude Code
- **Context:** Building custom AI agents and workflows, often reusing patterns and configurations from other projects
- **Pain Points:** No centralized place to find proven agent configurations, reinventing the wheel for common patterns, difficulty sharing agent files with team members
- **Goals:** Quickly discover useful agent configurations, easily share their own agent files, copy and adapt existing configurations for their projects

## The Problem

### Fragmented Agent File Sharing
AI developers using Claude Code lack a centralized platform to share and discover agent configuration files. This leads to duplicated effort, missed opportunities to learn from proven patterns, and difficulty collaborating on agent development. Teams often resort to sharing files through email, Slack, or GitHub repositories, making discovery and reuse inefficient.

**Our Solution:** A simple, focused web application where developers can post their Claude Code agent files, browse files shared by others, and easily copy configurations for reuse in their own projects.

## Differentiators

### Focused on Claude Code Agent Files
Unlike generic code sharing platforms, we specialize exclusively in Claude Code agent files (.md files), providing a curated space optimized for this specific use case. This results in better discoverability and relevance for our target users.

### Simple, No-Friction Experience
Unlike platforms requiring authentication and complex setup, we provide a straightforward front-end experience with static/mock data, allowing users to immediately start browsing and sharing without barriers. This results in faster adoption and easier exploration of available agent configurations.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Post Agent Files:** Users can upload and share their Claude Code agent files (.md files) with descriptions
- **Browse Agent Files:** Users can browse a collection of agent files shared by others, with descriptions and previews
- **View File Details:** Users can open individual agent files to see full descriptions and content previews
- **Copy File Contents:** Users can easily copy the contents of any agent file for reuse in their own projects

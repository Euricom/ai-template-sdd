# Product Mission

## Pitch

Agent Hub is a community platform that helps AI developers and teams using Claude Code share and discover agent files (.md files) by providing a centralized repository where users can browse, preview, and copy agent configurations for reuse in their own projects.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual AI Developers**: Solo developers building with Claude Code who want to leverage community knowledge and share their own agent configurations
- **Development Teams**: Teams standardizing their Claude Code workflows and looking for proven agent patterns to accelerate development
- **AI Development Educators**: Instructors and content creators who need to share example agent files with students or audiences

### User Personas

**Solo AI Developer** (25-45 years)

- **Role:** Independent developer or consultant building AI-powered applications
- **Context:** Working on multiple projects with Claude Code, often solving similar problems across different codebases
- **Pain Points:** Reinventing agent configurations for common tasks; no easy way to find proven agent patterns; isolated from the community's collective knowledge
- **Goals:** Find reliable agent files to accelerate development; share successful configurations to build reputation; learn from others' approaches

**Engineering Team Lead** (30-50 years)

- **Role:** Technical lead managing a team using Claude Code for development
- **Context:** Overseeing multiple projects where consistency in agent usage would improve team productivity
- **Pain Points:** Team members creating redundant agent files; lack of standardization across projects; difficulty discovering what's already been solved
- **Goals:** Establish best practices for agent usage; enable team to learn from community; contribute team's solutions back to ecosystem

## The Problem

### Agent Files Are Trapped in Individual Projects

Claude Code users are creating valuable agent files (.md) for various development tasks, but these files remain isolated in individual projects. There's no easy way to discover what agents exist, understand what they do, or reuse proven configurations. This results in wasted time as developers recreate solutions that others have already perfected, and the community misses out on collective learning and standardization.

**Our Solution:** We provide a simple, browseable repository where users can post their agent files with descriptions, preview content before copying, and quickly integrate proven solutions into their own projects. By making agent files discoverable and accessible, we accelerate the entire Claude Code ecosystem.

## Differentiators

### Simplicity First

Unlike complex code sharing platforms with authentication, databases, and social features, we provide an immediate, friction-free experience with static mock data. Users can instantly browse, preview, and copy agent files without creating accounts or learning complex workflows. This results in faster adoption and focus on the core value proposition.

### Claude Code Native

Unlike generic file sharing services, we're purpose-built for Claude Code agent files. Every aspect of the browsing experience—from file descriptions to content preview—is optimized for understanding and evaluating agent configurations before use. This results in better decision-making and faster integration.

### Community-Driven Discovery

Unlike searching through documentation or GitHub repositories, we provide a curated, organized view of agent files specifically designed for browsing and discovery. Users can quickly scan descriptions and preview content to find exactly what they need. This results in reduced time from need to solution.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Agent File Posting:** Users can submit their Claude Code agent files with descriptions to share with the community
- **Browseable Repository:** Clean, organized interface showing all available agent files with descriptions and preview snippets
- **File Detail View:** Open any agent file to see its full description, complete content, and usage context
- **One-Click Copy:** Copy agent file contents to clipboard for immediate use in Claude Code projects

### Discovery Features

- **Content Preview:** See a preview of agent file contents while browsing to evaluate relevance before opening
- **Description Display:** Each file shows a clear description explaining what the agent does and when to use it
- **Visual File Cards:** Clean card-based layout makes scanning multiple agent files quick and intuitive

### Future Features (Post-MVP)

- **Search and Filter:** Find specific agent files by keywords, use cases, or categories
- **User Ratings:** Community feedback on which agent files are most useful
- **Version History:** Track updates to agent files over time
- **Real Backend Integration:** Move from static mock data to persistent storage with user accounts
